# Drew Anki Decks
An **unofficial** collection of Anki decks to study for classes at [Drew School](https://www.drewschool.org/).

Anki is a flashcard program that uses [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and [active recall testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_test) to help users remember things faster and longer.

## Students
If you are a student, feel free to contribute! If you find inaccurate information, update and export the deck, and put in a [PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to add it to the decks. If you are studying for a test, create a new deck and put in a [PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
