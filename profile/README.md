# Drew Anki Decks
A collection of Anki decks to study for classes at [Drew School](https://www.drewschool.org/)

Anki is a flashcard program that uses [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and [active recall testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_test) to help users remember things faster and longer.

If you are a teacher or administrator and would like to have notes of your class taken down or have a problem with notes being avalible online, please contact: `verysaltypickles@gmail.com`.
